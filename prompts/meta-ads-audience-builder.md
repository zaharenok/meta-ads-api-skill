Find the right targeting options for your Facebook and Instagram campaigns based on your ideal customer.

## When to Use

- Setting up new ad campaigns
- Expanding beyond current audiences

## Input Requirements

Provide details about your ideal customer:
1. **Demographics**: Age, gender, location, language
2. **Psychographics**: Interests, values, lifestyle
3. **Behaviors**: Purchase habits, device usage, life events
4. **Problems**: What pain points does your product solve?
5. **Customer Data**: What first-party data do you have?
6. **Competitors**: Who else are they buying from?

## Audience Building Framework

### Tier 1: First-Party Data (Highest Quality)

**Custom Audiences from Customer Lists**:
- Email subscribers
- Past purchasers
- High-value customers (top 20%)
- Recent customers (last 90 days)
- Lapsed customers (for win-back)

**Custom Audiences from Website**:
- All website visitors (30/60/180 days)
- Product page viewers
- Add to cart, didn't purchase
- Blog readers / content engagers
- Time on site (top 25%)

**Custom Audiences from App**:
- App installers
- In-app purchasers
- Specific action completers

**Custom Audiences from Engagement**:
- Instagram/Facebook page visitors
- Video viewers (25%/50%/75%/95%)
- Lead form openers
- Ad engagers (saved, clicked, commented)

### Tier 2: Lookalike Audiences

**Building Effective Lookalikes**:

| Source Audience | Best For | Recommended Size |
|-----------------|----------|------------------|
| Purchasers | Acquisition at scale | 1-3% |
| High-value purchasers | Quality over volume | 1% |
| Email subscribers | Newsletter/content | 1-3% |
| Add to carts | Purchase intent | 2-5% |
| Page engagers | Awareness | 3-5% |

**Lookalike Size Guidelines**:
- 1%: Highest quality, smallest reach
- 2-3%: Good balance for most
- 5-10%: Broad reach, lower precision

### Tier 3: Interest & Behavior Targeting

**Interest Categories**:
- Industry-related pages/brands
- Complementary product categories
- Publications your audience reads
- Influencers they follow
- Hobbies and activities

**Behavior Targeting**:
- Purchase behavior (engaged shoppers, etc.)
- Device usage (iPhone users, etc.)
- Life events (new job, recently moved)
- Travel behavior (frequent travelers)
- Digital activities (Facebook payments users)

### Tier 4: Demographic Targeting

**Use sparingly, mainly for**:
- Age restrictions (alcohol, etc.)
- Gender-specific products
- Location-based businesses
- Language requirements

## Audience Strategy by Funnel Stage

### Cold Traffic (Top of Funnel)

**Audiences**:
1. Add to cart abandoners (1-14 days)
2. Product page viewers (7-30 days)
3. Past purchasers (cross-sell/upsell)
4. Lead form abandoners

**Budget Split**: 10-20% of spend

## Interest Research Methods

### Finding Relevant Interests

1. **Facebook Audience Insights** (in Ads Manager)
   - Analyze your existing audience
   - Find related pages they follow

2. **Competitor Research**
   - What pages/brands do competitors target?
   - Who follows your competitors?

3. **Customer Research**
   - Survey customers on interests
   - Analyze customer social profiles

4. **Industry Research**
   - Trade publications
   - Industry events/conferences
   - Professional associations

### Interest Stacking

**AND Logic** (Narrowing):
```
Interest: [Running] AND Interest: [Marathon]
= Serious runners, not casual joggers
```

**OR Logic** (Expanding):
```
Interest: [Running] OR Interest: [Triathlon] OR Interest: [CrossFit]
= Fitness enthusiasts
```

## Common Targeting Mistakes

1. **Too narrow too fast**: Start broad, then narrow
2. **Overlapping audiences**: Causes self-competition
3. **Ignoring exclusions**: Wasting money on wrong people
4. **Stale custom audiences**: Need regular updates
5. **Too many interests**: Dilutes targeting
6. **Wrong lookalike source**: Garbage in, garbage out

## Questions to Ask

1. What customer data do you have (emails, phone numbers)?
2. Describe your best customers - who are they?
3. What brands/publications would your audience follow?
4. What competitors are your customers also buying from?
5. Any geographic or demographic restrictions?
