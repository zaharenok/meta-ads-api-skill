# Meta Ads Ad Copy Writer

Write primary text for Facebook and Instagram ads that sounds like your brand, not like every other ad.

## When to Use

- Creating new Facebook/Instagram ad campaigns
- Writing A/B test variations
- Refreshing fatigued ad creative
- Adapting copy for different audiences
- Improving underperforming ads

## Input Requirements

Provide:
1. **Product/Service**: What you're promoting
2. **Target Audience**: Who you're speaking to
3. **Brand Voice**: How your brand sounds (examples help)
4. **Offer/Hook**: What makes this ad compelling
5. **Goal**: What action you want (click, purchase, sign up)
6. **Previous Ads**: Examples of copy that worked (if available)

## Copy Formats by Objective

### Direct Response (Purchases)

**Structure**:
```
[Hook - stop the scroll]
[Problem - what pain point?]
[Solution - your product]
[Proof - why believe you]
[CTA - what to do next]
```

**Length**: 125-250 characters for link click, up to 500 for engagement

### Lead Generation

**Structure**:
```
[Question or bold claim]
[What they'll get]
[How easy it is]
[What happens after]
```

**Key**: Lower commitment language, emphasize free/instant/easy

### Brand Awareness

**Structure**:
```
[Story or statement]
[Brand position]
[Emotional connection]
```

**Key**: Less salesy, more about identity and values

## Voice Calibration

### Identifying Brand Voice

Ask for or observe:
- **Existing copy**: Website, emails, other ads
- **Personality traits**: Professional? Playful? Bold? Warm?
- **Vocabulary**: Industry jargon ok? Simple words? Slang?
- **Tone markers**: Emojis? Exclamation points? Questions?

### Voice Spectrum

| Dimension | Formal <-----> Casual |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Vocabulary | "utilize" ... "use" |
| Contractions | "do not" ... "don't" |
| Sentences | Long/complex ... Short/punchy |
| Punctuation | Periods ... Emojis! |
| Address | "Customers" ... "You" ... "Y'all" |

```

**Warm/Personal**:

"Okay, weird tip, but hear me out."
"I'm going to say something controversial."

"Join [number] [people] who already [benefit]"
"[Impressive stat] and counting"
"Don't take our word for it — [proof point]"

"[Group], we need to talk."

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Facebook Feed
- Longer copy can work (up to 500 chars)
- More text-heavy audience
- Story format performs well

### Instagram Feed
- Shorter copy preferred (125-200 chars)
- Visual-first, copy supports
- Hashtags optional (3-5 max in copy)

### Stories/Reels
- Ultra-short (under 100 chars)
- Text often overlaid on creative
- Strong CTA essential

### Messenger
- Conversational tone
- Question-based hooks
- Personal feel

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Generic openings**: "Looking for [product]?" (everyone skips this)
2. **Feature dumps**: List of specs instead of benefits
3. **Fake urgency**: "ACT NOW!" without real reason
4. **Competitor bashing**: Usually backfires
5. **Too much text**: Wall of text = scroll past
6. **Wrong voice**: Sounding nothing like the brand

## Questions to Ask

1. Share 2-3 examples of copy you like from your brand
2. Who specifically are we talking to?
3. What's the ONE thing you want them to remember?
4. What objections might they have?
5. What's the actual offer/next step?
